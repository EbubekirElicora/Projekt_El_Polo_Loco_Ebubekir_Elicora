# Project: El Pollo Loco

A fully implemented 2D browser game built from scratch using object-oriented JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  
This project demonstrates architectural thinking, structured software design and the ability to translate complex logic into clean, maintainable code.

# Purpose of the Project

El Pollo Loco serves as a practical demonstration of:
- real game mechanics without a game engine
- class-based architecture in JavaScript
- clear separation of concerns
- system-driven thinking and problem-solving

The project goes far beyond simple DOM scripting and instead represents a **self-built mini-game-engine** with animations, physics, collision handling and game logic.

# Frontend Technologies

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **HTML5 Canvas Rendering**
- **CSS3**
- Sprite animation techniques  
- Custom keyboard and mobile input handling  
- Responsive layout adjustments for different screen sizes


# Architecture Overview

The game is structured into modular, reusable classes:

- Rendering & animation systems  
- Movement & physics calculations  
- Collision detection  
- Entity management (Player, Enemies, Items)  
- World management with independent update cycles  
- Data-driven sprite and asset loading  

This architecture ensures clarity, extendability and maintainability — similar to how modern engines separate systems and responsibilities.

# Features

- Smooth Jump-&-Run mechanics  
- Enemy AI with multiple states  
- Throwable objects (Tabasco bottles)  
- Collectable items (coins, salsa)  
- Parallax backgrounds  
- Custom game loop, update & draw cycle  
- Manual physics implementation  
- Sound, animation and UI feedback  
- Mobile-friendly control layout  

# What I Learned

Building El Pollo Loco strengthened several core development skills:

- Designing clean OO-architectures in JavaScript  
- Structuring complex applications into modules  
- Writing stable update cycles for real-time rendering  
- Debugging animations, physics and timing issues  
- Maintaining readability in a growing codebase  
- Translating game design ideas into working mechanics  

This project improved my ability to think in systems and produce maintainable, production-grade code — skills directly applicable to professional software development.
